# Welcome to my private repo collection.

I am Søren (Soren) K.S. Gregersen. This is my private repo collection. All of my code is usually MIT licenced, so you can use it freely.

If you are looking to contact me in regards to my day-job as Assistant Professor in Computer Vision at DTU Compute, then look at [https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/søren-k-s-gregersen] instead.
